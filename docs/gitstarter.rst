Git Starter Guide
=================

Git and SVN differences
-----------------------

- Git is much faster than Subversion​
- Subversion allows you to check out just a subtree of a repository; Git requires you to clone the entire repository (including history) and create a working copy that mirrors at least a subset of the items under version control.​
- Git's repositories are much smaller than Subversions (for the Mozilla project, 30x smaller)​
- Git was designed to be fully distributed from the start, allowing each developer to have full local control​
- Git branches are simpler and less resource heavy than Subversion's​
- Git branches carry their entire history​
- Merging in Git does not require you to remember the revision you merged from (this benefit was obviated with the release of Subversion 1.5)​
- Git provides better auditing of branch and merge events​
- Git's repo file formats are simple, so repair is easy and corruption is rare.​
